Using git with the Knop Project
===============================
This article assumes that you have a GitHub account and installed git.

The Knop Project uses the "fork and pull" model for collaboration.  This article provides explicit instructions to developers so they can follow this model and be effective collaborators in the project.

1. While logged into your GitHub account, navigate to the Knop Project on GitHub.

	<https://github.com/knop-project/knop>

2. We strongly recommend that you __click the Watch button__ so that you can follow progress of the project.

3. __Fork the Knop Project repository__ to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button.  At the time of this writing, this button appeared in the upper-right corner beneath your account name.

4. __Clone your fork__ of Knop from your GitHub account to your local computer.  The URL to use in the command will be the SSH option, and appears like this:

		git@github.com:USERNAME/knop.git
	
	In your Terminal application, enter the following command, substituting your account username as noted.

		git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/knop.git
